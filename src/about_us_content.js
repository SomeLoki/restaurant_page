    text: "At Glaze Craze Donuts, we don't just sling donuts we curate moments of pure, unadulterated joy, one handcrafted ring at a time. Born in a repurposed warehouse loft in Sweetville’s arts district, our little shop is a love letter to small-batch craftsmanship, bold flavors, and the kind of community that lingers over a third-wave coffee and a vinyl record spinning in the background.",

    section: "about",
    text: "We source our ingredients from local farmers’ markets and urban beekeepers, because we believe in keeping it real. Down to the organic flour milled by that guy with the handlebar mustache at the co-op. Our flavors are inspired by late-night musings and far-flung travels: think smoky maple glazes born from campfire nostalgia, zesty citrus curds evoking coastal summer markets, or warm chai spices that feel like a hug from an old friend. Every donut is a story of intention, rolled out by hand and fried with a reverence for the art of indulgence. No assembly lines, no shortcuts just pure, doughy alchemy.",

    section: "about",
    text: "Our crew? A ragtag collective of bakers, dreamers, and flavor obsessives who’ve traded corporate cubicles for aprons and late-night glaze experiments. We’re here to challenge the status quo of boring breakfast pastries, one daring flavor at a time. So pull up a mismatched vintage chair, sip on our house-roasted cold brew, and let’s talk about why donuts are basically edible poetry.",
